# Vagabond

Vagabond is a free and open-source platform utilized for threat prevention, detection, and response. It boasts the capability to safeguard workloads across a variety of environments including on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based setups.

The Vagabond solution comprises an endpoint security agent, deployed onto the monitored systems, and a management server, responsible for collecting and analyzing data gathered by the agents. Moreover, Vagabond has been seamlessly integrated with the Elastic Stack, offering a search engine and data visualization tool enabling users to navigate through their security alerts effectively.

Vagabond Capabilities
Here's a concise overview of some of the key functionalities of the Vagabond solution.

Intrusion Detection

Vagabond agents conduct scans on monitored systems, detecting malware, rootkits, and suspicious anomalies. They are adept at uncovering hidden files, cloaked processes, unregistered network listeners, and inconsistencies in system call responses. Additionally, the server component utilizes a signature-based approach to intrusion detection, leveraging its regular expression engine to scrutinize collected log data for indicators of compromise.

Log Data Analysis

Vagabond agents parse operating system and application logs, securely forwarding them to a central manager for rule-based analysis and storage. In the absence of an agent, the server can also receive data via syslog from network devices or applications. The rules employed by Vagabond help in identifying application or system errors, misconfigurations, attempted and/or successful malicious activities, policy violations, and various other security and operational issues.

File Integrity Monitoring

Vagabond monitors the file system, identifying changes in content, permissions, ownership, and attributes of files requiring attention. Furthermore, it natively identifies users and applications involved in creating or modifying files. This capability, coupled with threat intelligence, aids in identifying threats or compromised hosts and aligns with regulatory compliance standards such as PCI DSS.

Vulnerability Detection

Vagabond agents retrieve software inventory data, sending it to the server where it is correlated with continuously updated CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure) databases to identify well-known vulnerable software. Automated vulnerability assessment assists in identifying weak spots in critical assets, enabling corrective action to be taken proactively.

Configuration Assessment

Vagabond monitors system and application configuration settings to ensure compliance with security policies, standards, and hardening guides. Agents conduct periodic scans to detect applications that are known to be vulnerable, unpatched, or insecurely configured. Additionally, configuration checks can be customized to align with organizational requirements, with alerts providing recommendations, references, and mapping with regulatory compliance.

Incident Response

Vagabond offers out-of-the-box active responses to execute various countermeasures in response to active threats, such as blocking access to a system from the threat source when specific criteria are met. Additionally, it can be utilized to remotely run commands or system queries, aiding in identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs) and facilitating other live forensics or incident response tasks.

Regulatory Compliance

Vagabond offers essential security controls to aid in achieving compliance with industry standards and regulations. Its scalability and multi-platform support make it well-suited for helping organizations meet technical compliance requirements, including PCI DSS, with its web user interface providing reports and dashboards to assist with compliance efforts.

Cloud Security

Vagabond assists in monitoring cloud infrastructure at an API level, leveraging integration modules to extract security data from leading cloud providers such as Amazon AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Furthermore, it provides rules to evaluate the configuration of cloud environments, aiding in the identification of weaknesses. Additionally, its lightweight and multi-platform agents are commonly employed to monitor cloud environments at the instance level.

Containers Security

Vagabond delivers security visibility into Docker hosts and containers, monitoring their behavior and detecting threats, vulnerabilities, and anomalies. The Vagabond agent seamlessly integrates with the Docker engine, allowing users to monitor images, volumes, network settings, and running containers effectively.
